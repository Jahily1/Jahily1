Industrial Engineer and Business Analytics student in Canada.

## 🌎 My Journey
Industrial Engineer from Colombia with experience at **Ernst & Young** analyzing business processes.  
My growing curiosity for data led me into **Data Science, Big Data, and Power BI**, and I’m currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in **Business Analytics in Canada** as an international student.  

I’m growing as a **Business Data Analyst**, creating insights that support informed decision-making — especially in projects connected to sustainability and social impact.
