# Hi, I’m Jahily Andrea Morales 👋

### Business Data Analyst | Curious • Passionate • (A little) Goofy 😄

I’m an optimistic and curious data enthusiast who loves learning new things and turning data into stories that create real-world impact. I enjoy combining analytical thinking with creativity and I always bring good energy to the work I do.

## 🌎 My Journey

I hold a degree in **Industrial Engineering** from Colombia and began my professional career at **Ernst & Young**, where I worked analyzing business processes. That experience showed me how powerful data can be for driving smarter decisions.

Motivated to learn more, I dove into **Data Science, Big Data, and Power BI** through specialized training and certifications. I discovered how much I truly enjoy working with data, so I took the next step and moved to **Canada** to study **Business Analytics** as an **international student**.

My goal is to grow as a **Business Data Analyst**, adding value to organizations through insights, storytelling, and data-driven strategies — especially in areas connected to sustainability and social impact.
